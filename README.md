## Main libraries
### Selenium Webdriver for Java
Java based library that performs all operations against UI of the web application.

### REST Assured
REST Assured is a Java based library designed for simplifying and automating the testing of RESTful APIs. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing concise and expressive tests for HTTP-based services.

### TestNG
Testing framework inspired from JUnit that provides powerful functionalities used like parallel execution, test methods dependency or XML files in order to have more control on test executions.
